  You have 2 options for running OSSIM agent

    1) Right from the own directory:

      # ln -sf $OSSIM_PATH/agent/ossim-agent /usr/local/bin/
 
    2) Install it into your system:

      # python setup.py install


  If you want to create a .tgz file, just type:

      # python setup.py bdist

  A binary .tgz package will be created under dist/ directory.

  The same for creating a .rpm file, just typing:

      # python setup.py bdist_rpm

  For a list of all available commands type:

    # python setup.py --help-commands
