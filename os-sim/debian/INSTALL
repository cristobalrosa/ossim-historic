 0. Before installing OSSIM
 ==========================

 Apt configuration
 -----------------

 - Edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list to set the repositories of Debian
   Sarge and OSSIM:

    [ -- /etc/apt/sources.list -- ]
    deb http://security.debian.org/ sarge/updates main
    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sarge main
    deb http://www.ossim.net/download/ debian/

 - Update your dpkg info with:

   # apt-get update

 - Create a /etc/apt/preferences file like this:

    [ -- /etc/apt/preferences -- ]
    Package: *
    Pin: release o=ossim
    Pin-Priority: 995

   This way apt will assign a higher priority to OSSIM  packages and their
   dependencies. Please, see the apt_preferences manual page for more info.


 Performance
 -----------

 - Install a 2.6 Linux kernel. We notice a much better efficiency in terms
   of performances and in comparison with a 2.4 kernel:

    # apt-get update && apt-get install kernel-image-2.6-686

 - Install hdparm to also increase the performance of your hard drive,
   especially for the computer which will host the database:

    # apt-get install hdparm

    [ -- /etc/hdparm.conf -- ]
    # Activate DMA + Safe Performance-enhancing Options
    /dev/hda {
        dma = on
        lookahead = on
        mult_sect_io = 16
        interrupt_unmask = on
        read_ahead_sect = 64
    }
 
 Clean up your system
 --------------------
 
 - Install deborphan in order to remove orphaned libraries:

   # apt-get install deborphan
   # apt-get remove --purge `deborphan`

 - Configure your runlevel scripts. You may run on startup only the services
   you really want. Install a runlevel configuration tool like rcconf or
   sysv-rc-conf.

   
 1. Install ossim-mysql
 =======================

 - Install it:
    # apt-get install ossim-mysql

 - Set a root password for your database:
    # mysqladmin -u root password tu_password_super_secreto

 - Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and modify the "bind-address" entry if you want MySQL
   will listen on port TCP-3306 after restart.

 - Then load the tables in the database:
 
    # mysql -u root -p
    
    mysql> create database ossim;
    mysql> create database snort;
    mysql> exit;
    
    # zcat /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/create_mysql.sql.gz \
        /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/ossim_config.sql.gz \
        /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/ossim_data.sql.gz \
        /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/realsecure.sql.gz | \
        mysql -u root ossim -p

    # zcat /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/create_snort_tbls_mysql.sql.gz \
        /usr/share/doc/ossim-mysql/contrib/create_acid_tbls_mysql.sql.gz \
        | mysql -u root snort -p


 2. Install OSSIM Server
 ========================

 - Install it with apt:
    # apt-get install ossim-server

 - You will be prompt for your network properties and for your database
   connections. Use "dpkg-reconfigure ossim-server" if you want to update the
   server configuration (don't edit /etc/ossim/server/config.xml by hand)


 3. Install OSSIM Agent
 =======================

 - Install the plugins you want to use with OSSIM (see appendix A)
 
 - Install ossim-agent:
    # apt-get install ossim-agent

 - You will be prompt for your sensor configuration. Use "dpkg-reconfigure
   ossim-agent" if you want to update the agent configuration (don't edit
   /etc/ossim/agent/config.xml by hand)


 4. Install OSSIM Framework
 ===========================

 - Install phpgacl package:
   # apt-get install phpgacl

   Create the database that will store de acl information (ossim_acl)
   # mysqladmin create ossim_acl -p

 - Install ossim-framework and all its dependencies:
    # apt-get install ossim-framework

 - You will be prompt for your database configuration (ossim & ossim_acl
   databases). Use "dpkg-reconfigure ossim-utils" and "dpkg-reconfigure
   ossim-framework" if you want to update the framework configuration (don't
   edit /etc/ossim/framework/ossim.conf by hand)
 
 - Access the framework [ http://yourhost/ossim/ ] and go to configuration
   menu Configuration->Main (you should only change some passwords, if not,
   let us know as we'll try make a more fully automated installation).


 5. Install OSSIM utils
 =======================

 - The ossim-framework package depends on the ossim-utils one, so you need
   to have it installed. If you want to have it installed on another host:
    # apt-get install ossim-utils
   
   Maybe you'll have to reconfigure ossim-utils (dpkg-reconfigure ossim-utils)
   to configure the database access parameters of some scripts. We'll soon
   have a solution at this problem.


 6. Install OSSIM contrib (optional)
 ===================================

  - The package ossim-contrib contains a set of patches, examples and
    configuration files used by the ossim distribution. This package is only
    useful for development purposes.


 7. Post OSSIM installation
 ===========================

 - The package ossim is a meta-package which depends on the the other ones.
   Moreover it adds a startup file to run OSSIM at the boot of the host.
   
   # apt-get install ossim

 
 8. TODO
 ========

 - Nessus integration
 - OpenNMS integration

 (You can find more info at http://www.ossim.net/docs/INSTALL.Debian.html)


 A. Install Plugins
 ===================

 A.1 Snort
 ---------

 - Install snort:
    # apt-get install snort-mysql

 - Don't configure snort database via debconf, it's better that you edit
   the file /etc/snort/snort.conf by hand:

    [ -- /etc/snort/snort.conf --]
    ..
    var HOME_NET [192.168.0.0/16]
    var EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET
    ..
    output database: alert, mysql, user=root password=yourdbpass dbname=snort host=yourdbhost sensor_name=your_sensor_ip logfile=fast.log
    ..
    #  if you want spade support obtain a valid spade.conf file 
    #  (for example from ossim source or from ossim-contrib package)
    include spade.conf
    ..
     
 - Check out http://www.bleedingsnort.com for up-to-date, bleeding edge 
   snort rules. The false positive rate is extremely low for little tested
   signatures and they are being very useful to us:

    # cd /etc/snort/rules/
    # wget http://www.bleedingsnort.com/bleeding-all.rules
    # echo "include \$RULE_PATH/bleeding-all.rules" >> /etc/snort/snort.conf

 - Update OSSIM database with the rules of your system:

   # /usr/share/ossim/scripts/create_sidmap.pl /etc/snort/rules | \
        mysql -u root ossim -p


 A.2 Ntop
 --------

 - Install Ntop
    # apt-get install librrd0 ntop
 
 - Define the password for the admin user 
    # ntop -u ntop
    >> Please enter the password for the admin user:
    # ^C
    # /etc/init.d/ntop start

 - Go to 'http://yourhost:3000/ to see Ntop in action. Activate the 
   rrdPlugin at Admin->plugins. Click on Host at Data Dump and specify
   your netmask at Hosts Filter.

 - In order to make RRD plugin of ntop working with ips instead of macs
   (needed by agent), edit '/etc/default/ntop' file and add "--no-mac" 
   to GETOPT="".


 A.3 Other plugins
 -----------------

 - As simple as:
    # apt-get install p0f arpwatch pads tcptrack

 - Don't run arpwatch on boot, let ossim-agent do the job:
    # update-rc.d -f arpwatch remove
