This documentation is intended to get better over time, anyhow, this is alpha
code. Install can become quite difficult at this time.

- Read CONFIG

In order to get os-sim up and working you need (at least) the following,
satisfying all their dependencies:

- A working experimental rrdtool release (1.1.0)
- ADOdb 3.72
- Mysql 4.0.13
- OpenNMS 1.0.2
    - PostgreSQL 7.3.2
    - Tomcat
- Ntop 2.2.0 (patched, patch included)
- A bunch of perl modules
- Apache 1.3.28, php 4.3.2.
- Snort 2.0
    - Spade
- Nmap 3.27
- Acid v0.9.6b20
- Mrtg 2.9.29
- Flex


Copy the file ossim.conf.sample to /etc/ossim.conf. Adjust permissions so web
server is able to read it.

Create snort & acid DB's; use db/create_ossim_tables.pl after creating a
database suitable for ossim (name it "ossim" or what you want, put it in
/etc/ossim.conf)

After that:

- edit $ossim_home/parser/Makefile and point snort rules path to your snort
  rules path.
- compile parser
- Create the whole database structure (Acid, snort, snort-extra, os-sim)
- start mysql
- Add an apache alias pointing to os-sim's www directory
- put $ossim_home/etc/cron.d/mrtg in roots crontab (will be removed soon)
- put $ossim_home/contrib/mrtg-ossim.cron in roots crontab
- put contrib/mrtg.tgz stuff where the crontab entry can find it (launch-mrtg)
- After patching mrtg adding the HWPREDICT line that appears in CONFIG write
  an additional config file that uses rrd (with additions from CONFIG) and
  fire it up. ($ossim_home/contrib/mrtg.diff)
- $ossim_home/etc/init.d/ossim start
- copy $ossim_home/scripts/draw_graph.pl to your cgi-bin directory.
- Start apache
- Start patched ntop
- Start opennms (not needed as of today)
- Point your browser at the web root.

Note: The parser reads its data from a standard text file. For remote
logging/parsing we use syslog but you can use anything you want that logs in syslog-like format.


Please post any suggestions, help requests, etc. to the lists and forums
