Sorry, installation is even more difficult than on past releases. Mail us if you need help, this doc is incomplete.

- Read CONFIG

In order to get os-sim up and working you need (at least) the following,
satisfying all their dependencies:

- A working experimental rrdtool release (1.1.0) (Development snapshot)
- ADOdb 3.94
- Mysql 4.0.15a
- OpenNMS 1.0.2
    - PostgreSQL 7.3.2
    - Tomcat
- Ntop 2.2.95 (patched, patch included)
- A bunch of perl modules
- Apache 1.3.28, php 4.3.3.
- Snort 2.0.2
    - Spade latest (http://www.silicondefense.com)
    - Hint: Use spade.more.conf as a base.
- Nmap 3.48
- Acid v0.9.6b23
- Mrtg 2.9.29
- P0f 2.0.3
- Arpwatch 2.1a11

Server deps:
- Flex (soon to be removed)
- From ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/:
    - latest glib2
        (note for debian users: install "libglib2.0-dev")
    - latest intltool
    - latest libgda
    - latest libxml2
    - latest libxslt
- From www.gnetlibrary.org
    - latest 2.x gnet (patched, patch included in /contrib/)
- A quite new auto* version => 2.53


- Copy the file ossim.conf.sample to /etc/ossim.conf. Adjust permissions so web
server is able to read it.

- Create snort & acid DB's; use db/create_ossim_tables.pl after creating a
database suitable for ossim (name it "ossim" or what you want, put it in
/etc/ossim.conf)

- Update your libgda config file with your information. Sample config
  included.

- Notes about patched ntop: init rrd plugin, limit hosts to your LAN since the number of files (and space used) can grow very fast.

After that:

- Use scripts/readsids to update server/sids if you use additional snort rules.
- compile server.
- IMPORTANT: make sure any paths you can define at this point in /etc/ossim.conf are correct (snort_rules_path is needed to correctly setup the DB)
- Create the whole database structure (Acid, snort, snort-extra, os-sim)
- start mysql
- Edit /etc/snort.conf so it logs both to mysql & syslog.
- Add an apache alias pointing to os-sim's www directory
- Add another apache alias pointing to acid and re-edit /etc/ossim.conf.
- Obtain arial.ttf and put it somewhere visible to ossim. Adjust
  /etc/ossim.conf and make sure rrdtool can find its default font.
- copy $ossim_home/etc/mrtg*.cfg to /etc and edit
- put contrib/mrtg.tgz stuff where the crontab entry can find it (launch-mrtg)
- After patching mrtg adding the HWPREDICT line that appears in CONFIG write
  an additional config file that uses rrd (with additions from CONFIG) and
  fire it up. (launch-mrtg) ($ossim_home/contrib/mrtg.diff)
- try to launch launch-mrtg, note and correct any errors
- put $ossim_home/etc/cron.d/mrtg in roots crontab (will be removed soon)
- Edit /etc/ossim.conf and point ossim_log to snorts syslog file (/var/log/messages?) if you want the server to read syslog data in directly.
- $ossim_home/etc/init.d/ossim start
- Edit agent/config.xml and edit server ip. Enable/disable plugins.
- copy $ossim_home/scripts/draw_graph.pl to your cgi-bin directory.
- Start apache
- Start patched ntop
- Start snort
- Start opennms (not needed as of today)
- Point your browser at the web root.

Note2: Make sure everything is fine at /etc/ossim.conf...
