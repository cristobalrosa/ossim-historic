- Relink graph functionality
- Relink graph drawing
- Integrate graphs in parser
- Ability to sort almost everything. Reverse order sort
- Search in hosts/networks
- Control Panel ntop integration, top three hosts traffic
+ Static control panel functionality
- Rule editor
- Install script
- Horizontal / Vertical graph relocation
- Hard link analisys using ntop's "sessions"
+ Buffer parser input
+ Use time-based policy
- Up and Download rules from sensor, edit/modify/delete rule groups, restart
  sensors.
- Update snort rules automagically
- Be able to dump & restore host, network and policy
- Insert ntop anomalies into control panel
- Integrate apache abuse with control panel

+ Insert nmap into ossim.conf, correct nmap_path where needed.
+ Add META no cache on dynamic pages
+ Modify != Insert. When modifying networks they get duplicated.
+ Network order in riskmeter ? How are networks drawn ? asort doesn't seem to
  work quite well...
+ Control panel network appearance ?
+ Control panel: show only nets that are in table "net" (eq. for hosts)
+ Parser keeps dying... can't open /etc/ossim.conf. Why is configuration
  re-read everytime an alert arrives ? why is an mysql connection established
  everytime an alert arrives ? Parser rewrite...
+ Parser doesn't take policy into account.
+ Add ossim_log to ossim.conf. ossim.init.d...
+ Using "buffer" may suppose loosing alerts (they get cut in two). Use tail blocking instead.
+ Popup host graph when clicking on A or C value in control panel.
+ Control Panel. Draw numbers in red when they get too high (threshold)
+ control_panel.pl relative paths...
+ Ntop link doesn't work well with 2 "//" in frameoptions popup..
+ When modifying policy, hosts get selected twice (source/dest is not being
  taken into account)
+ Serious vulnerability when calculating networks with nmap. Sanity check !!!!
- Ntop keeps dying after ntop modifications. sigh... 4 days without diying, debug.
+ Ips aren't substitued with Hostnames in Control Panel
- Don't open a mysql connection every time you insert a fw-1 alert.
- Only get MAX|MIN|AVG rrd values for top 5 control-panel hosts.
- Use intval() to escape integers (instead of settype()). Fix SQL injection.
- Get last maxC/maxA date, and show it at control_panel.

----

- p0f is too specific. Either take some anomalies into account or disable
  verbose os printing.
- parser dies after a few days.
- Rewrite arpwatch so it can use an interface without assigned address.
- Rewrite ntop so we use rrdtool 1.1.0 again.
- Specify multiple interfaces within config. Multiple local networks.

- Much much more...
