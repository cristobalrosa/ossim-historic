Frequently Asqued Questions
---------------------------

Q: Why arent't anomalies being drawn ?
A: Wait about 24-36H before the system knows what's normal.

Q: draw_graph.pl doesn't do anything. What's happening ?
A: Make sure font path is working, draw_graph.pl is placed in /cgi-bin/, has execute permission and you have an experimental rrd version running (>=1.1.0)

Q: RRD anomaly detection doesn't work. Why ?
A: Patch ntop, enable rrd plugin, enable host rrd drawing (but limit it to what you want). Specify the correct path and wait.

Disclaimer: These are just some samples. I'm sure there are hundreds of interesting questions. It depends on the end user to let this file grow and improve so it can help more users to get this up and running. I know ossim is very difficult to setup but please send any questions to os-sim-suppor@lists.sourceforge.net so we can help you and help others. Dk.
